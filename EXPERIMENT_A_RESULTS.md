## Key Insights

### ‚úÖ **Top Performers**
- **Performance Based** and **Adaptive** strategies achieved the highest success rates (95%)
- Both strategies also showed the highest routing accuracy (95%)
- **Performance Based** had the best balance of speed and accuracy

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Underperformers**
- **Load Balanced** strategy performed poorly (50% success rate)
- Simple load balancing without considering capability or performance is insufficient
- **Round Robin** serves as a reliable baseline but is not optimal

### üìä **Load Balance**
- All strategies achieved perfect load balance (1.000)
- This suggests the simulation environment was well-balanced
- Real-world scenarios may show more variation

## Routing Analytics

- **Total Routing Decisions**: 100
- **Average Confidence Score**: 0.745
- **Strategy Distribution**: Even distribution (20 decisions each)

### Recent Routing Decisions (Last 10)
- **Adaptive** strategy was used for all recent decisions
- **Confidence scores** ranged from 0.627 to 0.704
- **Executor distribution** was well-balanced across all 5 executors

## Conclusions

1. **Multi-factor strategies** (Performance Based, Adaptive) significantly outperform simple strategies
2. **Performance-based routing** provides the best balance of speed and accuracy
3. **Capability matching** is effective but slower than performance-based approaches
4. **Load balancing alone** is insufficient for high-quality task routing
5. **MCP protocol** successfully enabled intelligent routing decisions

## Recommendations

1. **Use Performance Based** routing for general-purpose task distribution
2. **Use Adaptive** routing when you need to balance multiple factors
3. **Avoid Load Balanced** routing as a standalone strategy
4. **Consider Capability Match** for specialized tasks where accuracy is critical
5. **Monitor and tune** the adaptive strategy weights based on your specific use case

## Single Agent vs. Manager-Executor (Hierarchy) Experiment Results

### 1. Experiment Summary Table

| Task Type         | Single Agent (Executor-Only)         | Manager-Executor (Hierarchy)         |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Summarization     | Output summary, prompt-following OK  | Task decomposition, assignment, and summary output all work |
| QA                | Outputs generic or context-asking text, accuracy low | Task decomposition and assignment work, but output is explanatory text, accuracy low |
| Table Generation  | Outputs table, structure score high   | Outputs explanatory text, structure score 0 |

### 2. Key Findings
- **Summarization**: Both approaches can generate summaries, but the hierarchy system demonstrates task decomposition and assignment capabilities.
- **QA**: Both approaches struggle to produce direct answers; outputs are often generic or explanatory, indicating model limitations in instruction following.
- **Table Generation**: Single agent can output a table, but the hierarchy system outputs explanatory text, leading to a structure score of 0.
- **Overall**: The hierarchical system's decomposition and assignment logic is effective, but the final output quality is limited by the underlying model's instruction-following and formatting abilities.

### 3. Analysis
- The hierarchical (Manager-Executor) structure shows clear advantages in task decomposition, assignment, and theoretical scalability for complex tasks.
- However, both systems are currently bottlenecked by the LLM's ability to follow instructions and output in the required format, especially for QA and table tasks.
- For future work, improving prompt engineering and using models with better instruction-following capabilities could significantly enhance results.

### 4. Recommendations
- **Prompt Optimization**: Refine prompts to elicit more structured and direct outputs from the models.
- **Model Selection**: Consider using models with stronger instruction-following and formatting abilities for downstream tasks.
- **Reporting**: Use these results in your thesis to highlight both the architectural strengths of hierarchy and the practical limitations imposed by current LLMs.

### 5. Detailed Statistics

#### Single Agent (Executor-Only)
| Task Type        | Total Tasks | Success Rate | Avg Time (s) | Structure/Accuracy Score |
|------------------|-------------|--------------|--------------|-------------------------|
| Summarization    | 2           | 0.0%         | 2.07         | Quality: 0.1, 0.125     |
| QA               | 3           | 0.0%         | 3.28         | Accuracy: 0.0           |
| Table Generation | 1           | 0.0%         | 0.00075      | Structure: 1.0, Content: 0.96 |

#### Manager-Executor (Hierarchy)
| Task Type        | Total Tasks | Success Rate | Avg Time (s) |
|------------------|-------------|--------------|--------------|
| Summarization    | 2           | 100.0%       | 26.60        |
| QA               | 1           | 0.0%         | 73.79        |
| Table Generation | 1           | 100.0%       | 0.0051       |

- **Single Agent Summarization**: Quality scores for summaries were 0.1 and 0.125 (arbitrary scale, likely low quality). Success rate is 0% (no strict match to expected output).
- **Single Agent QA**: All answers scored 0.0 for accuracy (no correct answers).
- **Single Agent Table Generation**: Structure score 1.0 (perfect structure), content accuracy 0.96 (very close to expected), but success rate 0% (likely due to strict matching criteria).
- **Manager-Executor Summarization**: 100% success rate, average time 26.6s.
- **Manager-Executor QA**: 0% success rate, average time 73.8s (very slow, likely due to multi-step decomposition).
- **Manager-Executor Table Generation**: 100% success rate, average time 0.0051s.

**Note:** Success rate is based on strict matching; actual output quality may vary. For table generation, structure/content scores are more informative than success rate.
