|----------|-------------------------|----------------------------|
| **Load Balanced** | -33.33% | -51.86% |
| **Performance Based** | +26.67% | -11.95% |
| **Capability Match** | +20.00% | -55.15% |
| **Adaptive** | +26.67% | -45.32% |

## Key Insights

### ‚úÖ **Top Performers**
- **Performance Based** and **Adaptive** strategies achieved the highest success rates (95%)
- Both strategies also showed the highest routing accuracy (95%)
- **Performance Based** had the best balance of speed and accuracy

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Underperformers**
- **Load Balanced** strategy performed poorly (50% success rate)
- Simple load balancing without considering capability or performance is insufficient
- **Round Robin** serves as a reliable baseline but is not optimal

### üìä **Load Balance**
- All strategies achieved perfect load balance (1.000)
- This suggests the simulation environment was well-balanced
- Real-world scenarios may show more variation

## Routing Analytics

- **Total Routing Decisions**: 100
- **Average Confidence Score**: 0.745
- **Strategy Distribution**: Even distribution (20 decisions each)

### Recent Routing Decisions (Last 10)
- **Adaptive** strategy was used for all recent decisions
- **Confidence scores** ranged from 0.627 to 0.704
- **Executor distribution** was well-balanced across all 5 executors

## Conclusions

1. **Multi-factor strategies** (Performance Based, Adaptive) significantly outperform simple strategies
2. **Performance-based routing** provides the best balance of speed and accuracy
3. **Capability matching** is effective but slower than performance-based approaches
4. **Load balancing alone** is insufficient for high-quality task routing
5. **MCP protocol** successfully enabled intelligent routing decisions

## Recommendations

1. **Use Performance Based** routing for general-purpose task distribution
2. **Use Adaptive** routing when you need to balance multiple factors
3. **Avoid Load Balanced** routing as a standalone strategy
4. **Consider Capability Match** for specialized tasks where accuracy is critical
5. **Monitor and tune** the adaptive strategy weights based on your specific use case
